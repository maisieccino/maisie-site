# Uses

This is a list of the things I use.

## In my rucksack

It's a Fjallraven Kanken I've had for years. It's boxy, big and stores
everything I need.

* My journal (Leuchtturm1917 A5 dotted)
* Pen (Kaweco Sport)
* Earplugs for loud places (Loop Engage)
* A fidget toy (for when I need to ground myself)
* Essential oils for grounding
