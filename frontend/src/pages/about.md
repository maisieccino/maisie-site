I'm a nerdy woman based in London, UK.

During weekdays, I'm a software engineer at Monzo Bank. I work on building
tools, decisioning rules and interfaces to help customers recognise frauds and
prevent them from becoming a victim.

Outside of work? I'm:

- Building fun, random projects in code.
- Taking photos on digital and film cameras.
- Climbing and helping to build our local trans climbing community.
- Feeding my local crows.
- Drinking and making tasty coffee.
- Experimenting with drum and bass.
- Making little blogs and YouTube videos about my life (rarely).
