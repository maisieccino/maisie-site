## The short version

In case your attention span has been ruined by LLMs.

I hate generative AI and will never use it.

Furthermore:

## The less short version

LLMs and generative AI is a fundamentally evil technology. It is built on stolen art and creativity, and trained using exploited global majority labour. It is aiming to replace the work of artists with low quality, generated slop.

AI usage has strong negative effects on mental health, attention span and problem solving skills.

As a result, I will not be using these tools in any aspect of my life or projects. Even if they were to improve productivity (they won't), I still will not use these tools.

My views are shared really well in Anthony Moser's post [I Am An AI Hater](https://anthonymoser.github.io/writing/ai/haterdom/2025/08/26/i-am-an-ai-hater.html).
